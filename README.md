# OpenAI - Atari

## Problem:

Create your own dataset of transitions from one of the Atari environments in openai gym. Create a model from this data that can predict the state at the next time step given the current time step and current action as input.

## Deliverables:

-the code and visualization of the results
-instructions on how to run

## Further Details:

-free to use whatever library you want to implement
-Please return this back to us in a week if possible. If you need a few more days, no worries just keep me posted!
-Be prepared to discuss this on your final interview
-The only thing we would like you to avoid, is copy someone else's solution online (if there are any)
